    Mentor: Prof. Dr. Lejla Abazi-Bexheti
    Version: 2.0

    Here I will try to restructure the program for inheritance and polymorphism by creating class person student faculty bodies etc etc........

    I want the program to be able to register students in study programmes that are in a department, register professors in a department that can be assigned to a course.
    Add, delete, search, edit students and professors.
    have a good class hierarchy and good code organization
    input validation etc.. from version 1!
    lets go 10 out 5 again...
    we will start after first inheritance lecture with prof
